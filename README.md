# RVR Answer Engine

> A multi-perspective research assistant API implementing Retrieve-Verify-Retrieve (RVR) methodology from arXiv:2602.18425. Traditional search returns limited results; RVR iteratively retrieves diverse, verified answers for complex queries where comprehensive coverage is critical. Ideal for legal research, medical literature review, and due diligence, the tool performs multi-round retrieval with verification to maximize answer coverage and minimize blind spots in research.
